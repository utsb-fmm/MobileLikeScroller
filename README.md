# MobileLikeScroller
A verylight JS transforming your div into a swipable area with mobile-like inertia, enhancing the desktop scrolling experience.

The other open source JS scrollers, which aim to imitate the inertia behavior of mobile devices, often exhibit unexpected behavior (e.g., ScrollBooster), or their inertia doesn't feel natural (e.g., iScroll is too fast in the middle). Moreover, these are heavy scripts for such a simple feature. The script presented here is a very simple script that uses the same inertia equation as mobile devices.
